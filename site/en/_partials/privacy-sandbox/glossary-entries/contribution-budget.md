Each call to the Private Aggregation API is called a [contribution](/docs/privacy-sandbox/private-aggregation-fundamentals/#contribution-budget). To protect user privacy, the number of contributions which can be collected from an individual are limited.

When you sum all aggregatable values across all aggregation keys, the sum must be less than the contribution budget.
